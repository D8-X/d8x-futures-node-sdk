# @d8x/perpetuals-sdk

This is a node TypeScript SDK for
[D8X Perpetual Futures](https://d8x.exchange/)

D8X provides fully decentralized perpetual futures implemented on the blockchain.

Using this SDK, you can execute many functions that the smart contracts offer, such as, providing liquidity and participating in the
exchange revenue, submitting on-chain orders, removing or adding collateral in one of your existing positions, executing any executable orders placed
and earn an execution fee, liquidating positions and earning a liquidator-fee.

Get started with the SDK [documentation](doc/d8x-perpetuals-sdk.md) or checkout [D8X gitbooks](https://d8x.gitbook.io/d8x).
